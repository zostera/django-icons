Renderers
=========

What is it?
-----------

A renderer converts your icon definition to HTML.

This package includes the default renderere `IconRenderer` which renders to an HTML element styled with CSS classes and other attributes, a method used by many icon libraries.

You can use a customized renderer to support specific icon libraries or code.
